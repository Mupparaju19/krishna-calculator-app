# Divine Power Calculator - Web Application

## Project Overview

**Divine Power Calculator** is a simple yet powerful web-based application that calculates the result of raising a base number to a given power (exponentiation). It allows users to enter a base number and an exponent to compute the power and display the result. The project is built using pure frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and is hosted using **GitHub Pages**.

This application serves as a hands-on example of creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces with basic web technologies.

## Features

- **Simple Exponentiation**: Allows users to input a base number and an exponent, and calculates the base raised to the power of the exponent.
- **Responsive Layout**: The app is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience across devices, from desktop to mobile.
- **Interactive UI**: Real-time calculation displayed dynamically with minimal interaction.
- **No Backend**: A pure frontend app with no server-side dependencies.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Clean and simple design with clear instructions.
  
## Tech Stack

The following technologies were used to build this application:

- **HTML**: Used for the structure and layout of the web page.
- **CSS**: Provides styling for the app, including layout and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for power calculation and user interactions.
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosting platform for deployment.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the app works well on all screen sizes.

## How to Use

1. Open the application using this URL:  
   [Divine Power Calculator](https://mupparaju19.github.io/krishna-calculator-app)

2. **Enter Base Number**: Input the base number (e.g., `2`).
3. **Enter Exponent**: Input the exponent (e.g., `5`).
4. **Click "Calculate"**: Press the calculate button to compute the power.
5. **View Result**: The result will be displayed below the button.

For example:
- Base number: `2`
- Exponent: `5`
- Result: `32` (since \( 2^5 = 32 \))

## Features and Improvements

- **Input Validation**: Ensure that both base and exponent are entered before calculating.
- **Enhanced UI/UX**: Add animations, improve button styles, and enhance the user interface.
- **Calculation History**: Implement a feature that shows a list of recent calculations made by the user.
- **Multiple Operations**: Extend the app to handle additional math operations (e.g., square root, factorial, logarithms).
- **Dark Mode**: Add a dark mode toggle for improved usability during nighttime usage.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For page structure, form elements, and content.
- **CSS3**: For styling the web page and making it responsive using Flexbox.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For handling logic such as calculating the power and manipulating DOM elements.
- **GitHub Pages**: For hosting the static files online.

## How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mupparaju19/krishna-calculator-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**:
   ```bash
   cd krishna-calculator-app
   ```

3. **Open the `index.html` File**:
   - Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the app locally.
   - Alternatively, you can host the app locally using a web server like **Live Server** (VSCode extension) or **http-server** (Node.js).

## Deployment Instructions

The application is deployed using **GitHub Pages**. Here's how the deployment was done:

1. **Push Files to GitHub**:
   - Make sure the project files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`) are pushed to a GitHub repository.

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - In the repository's **Settings** tab, scroll down to the **Pages** section.
   - Select the `main` branch as the source and choose `/ (root)` for the folder.
   - Click **Save**.

3. **Access the Live URL**:
   - After a few minutes, GitHub Pages will provide a URL where your app is live:
     ```text
     https://mupparaju19.github.io/krishna-calculator-app
     ```

   - This URL is where the app can be accessed publicly.
